Tree-watcher helps you watch entire directory trees, using fs.watch.

Usage:

var tw = require("tree-watcher");
tw.createWatcher("C:\\Program Files", {
	throttleTime: 50,
	filter: function(filename) {
		return filename.charAt(0) !== ".";
	}
});
tw.on("change", function(eventType, filePath) {
	console.log(arguments);
});



Features include:

- Watching subdirs as they are created (so no need to manually add watchers to newly created subdirs of a dir that is already watched)
- Getting the full path of a changed file as a parameter to the event handler
- Adding event handlers at any time (tw.createWatcher produces an EventEmitter that fires "change" events)
- Throttling change events (tree-watchers keeps track of the event/path combinations that get fired and adds the possibility to throttle these)
- filter out directory names that dont need to be watched (by adding a filter function)
